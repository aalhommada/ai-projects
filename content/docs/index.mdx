# Getting Started

Welcome to AI Engineering Projects. This platform provides hands-on tutorials for building production-ready AI systems.

## Prerequisites

Before starting any project, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.10+** installed
- **Git** for version control
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic understanding of Python and APIs

## Environment Setup

### 1. Install UV (Recommended)

UV is a fast Python package manager:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Get API Keys

Most projects require an OpenAI API key:

1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Create an account and add credits
3. Generate an API key
4. Store it securely in `.env` files

### 3. Choose Your Path

Select a learning path based on your goals:

| Path | Focus | Start Here |
|------|-------|------------|
| **RAG Specialist** | Document Q&A systems | [Intelligent Document Q&A](/docs/rag/basic/intelligent-document-qa) |
| **Full Stack AI** | End-to-end applications | [Simple Chatbot](/docs/llm-applications/basic/simple-chatbot) |
| **Production Engineer** | Deployment & scaling | [Model Serving](/docs/mlops/basic/model-serving) |

## Project Structure

Each project follows a consistent structure:

```
project-name/
├── src/           # Source code
├── tests/         # Test files
├── data/          # Sample data
├── .env           # Environment variables
└── README.md      # Project documentation
```

## Difficulty Levels

Projects are organized by complexity:

| Level | Time | Code Size | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Beginner | 1-2 hours | Under 200 LOC | Learn fundamentals |
| Intermediate | 4-8 hours | 200-500 LOC | Build real features |
| Advanced | 2-5 days | 500+ LOC | Production systems |
